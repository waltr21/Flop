# Flop Sort 
FlopSortFinal.java is the final complete version of this algorithm. FlopSort.java was used for testing.

## Results
The algorithm seems to be more efficient than many of the common sorting algorithms we see today. The catch is that this algorithm heavily favors recursion. Testing on a Macbook pro with an i7 processor and 16 gb of RAM shows flop sort beating an algorithm like quick sort upwards of 85% of the time (in terms of linear time measurement). When testing on a significantly weaker processor like the raspberry pi, the algorithm loses upwards of 90% of the time.
